Just a collection of homebrew applications for the Nintendo Switch.
Mostly intended to RE the Switch in context of the [yuzu Nintendo Switch Emulator](https://yuzu-emu.org/).

Following is a short description of each of the homebrews in this project:
- minimal: Doesn't do much, just a console homebrew that waits for the user to press PLUS and closes.
- time: Displays the current time as well as supported time zones. Navigate through time zones using DPad, Left Stick or Right Stick.
